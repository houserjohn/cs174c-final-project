Please refer to CS_174c_Team_Project_Report.pdf for our report and more details.

References:
We used code from examples (Collision Detection, Textures) included in the tiny graphics library. We also used the TA's shadow code from CS174A.

# How to run the code (node.js express server)
Our project implements a node.js express server that allows players to interact with eachother.

In order to run the code you must follow the following steps...

1) git clone/pull this repo 
2) enter the cs174c-final-project folder
3) type 'npm install' in CLI (get npm if you don't already have it)
4) type 'node index.js'
5) visit localhost:5000
